    "The model is the underfitting model, it means it provides an answer, but doesn't capture the underlying logic of the data.\n",

    "So it doesn't have strong predictive power, underfitting models are clumsy, they have high costs in terms of high loss function and their accuracy is low, so there are no relationships to be found or you need a complex model\n",

    "#### Overfitting\n",
    "\n",
    "The model is the overfitting model, it means it is a super good at modeling the training data that they fit or at least come very near each observation, so this model miss the point.\n",
    "\n",
    "The problem is that the random noise is captured inside an overfitting model, the model is probably overfit the data and it was trained to explain the training so well that is missed the point.\n",
